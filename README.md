## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of AWS
  - AWS IAM
  - AWS S3
  - AWS EC2, Security Groups, Autoscaling Groups, etc
  - AWS Lambda
  - A few other services
- Basic knowledge of `YAML` or `JSON` is preferred
- Recent macOS/Linux/Windows machine
- Motivation to learn ðŸ§ 

## What is CloudFormation?

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
  - I want a security group
  - I want two EC2 instances with this configuration
  - I want an S3 bucket
  - I want a Lambda function
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Here is an example of a CloudFormation template in `YAML`:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a
      ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      InstanceType: t2.micro
```

Above is a simple example of a CloudFormation template that creates an EC2 instance. Let me explain what you are ðŸ‘€ at:

1. `Resources`: This is the section where you define the AWS resources you want to create.
2. `MyEC2Instance`: This is the logical name of the resource. You can use this name to reference this resource in other parts of the template.
3. `Type`: This is the type of AWS resource you want to create. In this case, it's an EC2 instance.
4. `Properties`: These are the properties of the resource. In this case, we are specifying the Availability Zone, the AMI ID, and the Instance Type.
5. `AvailabilityZone`, `ImageId`, `InstanceType`: These are the properties of the EC2 instance that we are creating.
