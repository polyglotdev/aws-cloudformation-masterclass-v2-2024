  - AWS Lambda
  - A few other services
- Basic knowledge of `YAML` or `JSON` is preferred

## What is CloudFormation?

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure
- For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say:
  - I want a security group
  - I want two EC2 instances with this configuration
  - I want an S3 bucket
  - I want a Lambda function
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify

Here is an example of a CloudFormation template in `YAML`:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a
      ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      InstanceType: t2.micro
```

Above is a simple example of a CloudFormation template that creates an EC2 instance. Let me explain what you are ðŸ‘€ at:

1. `Resources`: This is the section where you define the AWS resources you want to create.
2. `MyEC2Instance`: This is the logical name of the resource. You can use this name to reference this resource in other parts of the template.
3. `Type`: This is the type of AWS resource you want to create. In this case, it's an EC2 instance.
4. `Properties`: These are the properties of the resource. In this case, we are specifying the Availability Zone, the AMI ID, and the Instance Type.
5. `AvailabilityZone`, `ImageId`, `InstanceType`: These are the properties of the EC2 instance that we are creating.

## What are the Benefits of CloudFormation?

- **Infrastructure as Code**
  - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control.
  - The code can be version controlled for example using Git.
  - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code as pull requests/merge requests.
- **Cost**
  - Each resource within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you.
  - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template.
  - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automate the deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreate them at 8 AM, safely.
- **Productivity**
  - Ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the fly.
  - Automate generation of Diagram for your templates!
  - Declarative programming (no need to figure out ordering and orchestration).
- **Separation of concern**: create many stacks for many apps, and many layers. Ex:
  - VPC stacks
  - Network stacks
  - App stacks
- **Don't reinvent the wheel**
  - Leverage existing templates on the web!
  - Leverage the documentation.

## What this course won't do?

- This course won't go over every AWS service because AWS offers around 42.240 products and services.
- Instead we'll go over understanding how to write CF templates in the perfect way
- Then you can apply the same concepts to any AWS service you want

## How does CloudFormation work?

When creating a stack, AWS CloudFormation makes underlying service calls to AWS to provision and configure your resources. CloudFormation can only perform actions that you have permission to do. For example, to create EC2 instances by using CloudFormation, you need permissions to create instances. You'll need similar permissions to terminate instances when you delete stacks with instances. You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage permissions.

The calls that CloudFormation makes are all declared by your template. For example, suppose you have a template that describes an EC2 instance with a t2.micro instance type. When you use that template to create a stack, CloudFormation calls the Amazon EC2 create instance API and specifies the instance type as t2.micro. The following diagram summarizes the CloudFormation workflow for creating stacks.

## Couple of things to keep in mind

1. Key Value Pairs are always capitalized in CloudFormation
2. Any course, and I mean any course that has anything to do with GCP, Azure, or AWS, if the course didn't come out the moment that every single feature you are using in the course did, it's likely that you will have to depend on the documentation, like every good engineer should. Content creators have impossible task of keeping up with the pace of cloud providers. So, if you are following along with this course, and you see that something has changed, please refer to the official documentation. I will do my best to keep the notes up to date, but I can't guarantee that I will be able to do so. DOCS DOCS DOCS!
3. Keep in mind if you are in the CloudFormation UI the events tab shows things in chronological order. So if you are sitting there depending on that to get you by, you will end up mad.

## What is  `yaml`

YAML is a human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages and is often used to write configuration files.

Here is an example of a `YAML` file:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: us-east-1a
      ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
      InstanceType: t2.micro
```

In the above example, we are creating an EC2 instance using `YAML`.

## What is `JSON`

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

Here is an example of a `JSON` file:

```json
{
  "Resources": {
    "MyEC2Instance": {
      "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
      "Properties": {
        "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1a",
        "ImageId": "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867",
        "InstanceType": "t2.micro"
      }
    }

  }
}
```

In the above example, we are creating an EC2 instance using `JSON`.

So yaml has:

- Key Value Pairs
- Nested Objects
- Support Arrays

> ðŸ§  If you create a S3 bucket without the attribute bucket_name set you will get a random.

## CloudFormation Update Behavior

- CloudFormation updates resources based on differences between what you submit and stack's current template
- Which method depends on which property you update for a resource.
- Update with no interruptions:
  - Some properties can be updated in place without interruption
  - For example, you can update the tags of an EC2 instance without interruption
- Update with Some interruptions:
  - Some properties can be updated in place with some interruption
  - For example, you can update the instance type of an EC2 instance with some interruption but if you update the EC2 instance type, you will have to stop and start the instance
- Replacement
  - Recreating resource with a new ID
  - Create the new resource, change references from other resources to the new resource, then deleted the old resource.
  - Example: updating an RDS DB instance AZ will require replacement

> ðŸ§  To delete an S3 bucket it needs to be **empty**.

## Understanding the CF Options

- Tags: Key Value pairs to help you identify your stacks
- Permissions: IAM permissions to create, update, delete stacks
- Notification Options: SNS topics to get notification on stack events
- Rollback on failure: Yes or No
- Rollback Configuration: (monitoring time and CloudWatch alarm)
- Stack Policy: JSON to control updates to specific resources
- Termination Protection: Protect against accidental deletion
- Quick-start Link: Pre-populate the stack with a template

## CloudFormation Building Blocks

- Template's components
- AWSTemplateFormatVersion: identifies the capabilities of the template
- Description: describes the template
- Transform: specifies one or more macros that AWS CloudFormation uses to process your template
- Metadata: objects that provide additional information about the template
- Resources: specifies the stack resources and their properties. MANDATORY
- Parameters: values to pass to your template at runtime
- Mappings: static variables for your template
- Conditions: List of conditions to perform resource creation
- Rules: validate a parameter or a combination of parameters during stack creation/update
- Template's helpers
  - References: `Ref` and `Fn::GetAtt`
  - Functions: `Fn::`
  - Pseudo Parameters: `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::Region`, etc
  - Intrinsic Functions: `Fn::Base64`, `Fn::FindInMap`, `Fn::GetAZs`, `Fn::Join`, `Fn::Select`, `Fn::Split`, `Fn::Sub`, `Fn::Transform`, `Fn::And`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::If`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Or`
  - Conditions Functions: `Fn::And`, `Fn::Equals`, `Fn::If`, `Fn::Not`, `Fn::Or`

## Parameters

Parameters in CloudFormation are a powerful way to customize your AWS infrastructure deployments. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what they are and how they work:

### **Purpose of Parameters**
   - **Customization**: Parameters allow you to pass values to your CloudFormation template at runtime, without having to hard-code them into the template. This makes your templates more reusable and flexible.
   - **Input Validation**: You can define the type of the parameter and constraints (like min/max value, allowed patterns, and allowed values) to ensure that the input is valid before the template is executed.

### **Types of Parameters**
   - **String**: General text, can include numbers.
   - **Number**: Numeric values, both integers, and floating points.
   - **List**: Sets of values that are passed as a single parameter. You can specify a list of numbers, strings, or AWS-specific types like a list of EC2 instance IDs.
   - **CommaDelimitedList**: A list of values that AWS CloudFormation passes to your script as a comma-separated list (e.g., for passing multiple values like in subnets or security groups).
   - **AWS-specific parameter types**: Such as `AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName`, which requires the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair.

### **Using Parameters**
To define a parameter in a CloudFormation template, you add an entry in the `Parameters` section of the template. Here's an example of a simple string parameter:

```yaml
Parameters:
  InstanceTypeParameter:
    Type: String
    Default: t2.micro
    Description: Enter the instance type for the EC2 instance.
    AllowedValues:
      - t2.micro
      - m1.small
      - m1.large
    ConstraintDescription: Must be a valid EC2 instance type.
```

### **Referencing Parameters**
You can reference parameters anywhere in your template with the `Ref` function. For example:

```yaml
Resources:
  EC2Instance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      InstanceType: !Ref InstanceTypeParameter
      ImageId: 'ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0'
```

### **Advanced Features**
   - **Pseudo Parameters**: AWS provides certain pseudo parameters that you can use in your templates. These are parameters that AWS sets automatically, like `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::Region`, and `AWS::StackId`.
   - **NoEcho**: For sensitive information, such as passwords, you can set the `NoEcho` property to `true` to prevent the value from being returned by describe or list actions.

[AWS Parameter Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html)

## SSM Parameter Type

- Reference parameter in System Parameter Manager
- Specify SSM parameter key as the value
- Cloudformation always fetches the latest value(you can't use a specific version)
- CF does not store Secure String values
- Validation done on SSM parameter keys but not on the values
- Supported SSM Parameter Types:
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Name`
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String>`
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<List<String>>`
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<CommaDelimitedList>`
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<AWS-Specific Parameter>`
  - `AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<List<AWS-Specific Parameter>>`

Example: Fetch Latest AMI ID's

```yaml
Parameters:
  LatestAMIId:
    Type: 'AWS::SSM::Parameter::Value<String>'
    Default: /aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2
    Description: Enter the latest AMI ID for the EC2 instance.
```

## Resources

- Resources are the core of your CloudFormation template
- Each resource will have a type, a name, and properties
- Resources are declared and can reference each other
- Resources can be of different types (AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::S3::Bucket, etc)
- Resources can have metadata, attributes, and update policies
- Resources can have deletion policies (what happens when you delete the stack)
- Resources can have dependencies on each other
- Resources can have outputs (return values)
- Resources can have conditions (if statements)
- Resources can have transformations (macros)
- Resources can have creation policies (wait for an S3 bucket to be created)
- Resources can have update policies (how to handle updates)
- Resources can have deletion policies (what to do when you delete the stack)
